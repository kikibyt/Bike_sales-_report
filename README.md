 Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of bike sales data to gain insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance. The data used for this analysis is contained in the file `bike_sales_data.csv`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Folder:** Contains the dataset used for analysis (sales.csv`).

4. **Notebooks Folder:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks used for data analysis and visualization. These include:

   - `data_preparation.ipynb`: Data preprocessing and cleaning.
   - `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
   - `report_generation.ipynb`: Generation of the final report.

5. **Reports Folder:** Stores the final report and any additional documentation.

6. **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Analysis Steps

The data analysis process is divided into the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** In this step, data is loaded, cleaned, and prepared for analysis. Any missing or inconsistent data is addressed to ensure the dataset is ready for exploration.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA involves the examination of data distributions, relationships between variables, and the creation of data visualizations. This step provides initial insights into the dataset.

3. **Report Generation:** The final report is generated, summarizing the findings of the analysis. This report may include key statistics, visualizations, and insights into bike sales.

## Dependencies
